# Learning NLP with Pytorch

This repo is a result of my learning in NLP from Natural Language Processing with PyTorch book by Delip Rao & Brian McMahan published by O'Reilly.

Requirement of this repo is mainly PyTorch, I recommend using Kaggle or Google colab to execute this notebook since they both have mostly all of the required packages pre-installed. The source of the codes is from this repo https://github.com/joosthub/PyTorchNLPBook.

I suggest before learning the code you have basic data science knowledge in Python and it's because this book teaches you to build neural network basically MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron).
